# Image-Classifier-Using-Tensorflow
In this project, I work with the Fashion MNIST dataset to train and evaluate a neural network model for image classification. I import necessary libraries, load and preprocess the dataset, and define the neural network model using Keras. The model includes a Flatten layer, a Dense hidden layer, and a Dense output layer. I compile the model with optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric, and then train it using the training data. After training, I save the model to a file and evaluate it on the test data to calculate accuracy. I also make predictions on the test images and visualize the results using Matplotlib, including showing the predicted and true labels of the test images, as well as the prediction probabilities in a bar chart.

In conclusion, this example demonstrates the entire process of training and evaluating a neural network model for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. It covers steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model definition, compilation, training, saving, evaluation, and visualization. By following this workflow, one can assess the performance of the trained model and gain insights into its accuracy and prediction probabilities, allowing for a thorough evaluation of the model's performance on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
